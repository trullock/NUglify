NUglify provides minify and compression methods for CSS, JavaScript and HTML files.

This repository is a fork of the [Microsoft Ajax Minifier](http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/) + additional features (e.g: HTML compressor) 

While dotnet Core is now relying on the **node.js** ecosystem for its client side tooling (e.g: minify), NUglify is **still useful** in scenarios where we need to access this tooling from a .NET application (not necessarily an ASP one) without having to install another developer platform.

The original AjaxMin documentation of the project is available [here](doc/readme.md)

See the [ChangeLog](changelog.md)

## Features

- JS minification
- - Fully ES2020 + ES2021 compliant
- Css minification
- HTML minification
  - Can help to reduce by 5-10% a standard HTML document
  - Supports several minifications methods: remove comments, collapse whitespaces, remove optional tags (p, li...), remove quoted attributes, remove specific attributes, decode HTML entities, compress inline style and script using NUglify
  - No regex involved, full HTML parser
  - Supports HTML5, works best on valid HTML documents (but can still work on invalid documents)
  - Similar to the popular [html-minifier in JS](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)
  - Super fast and GC friendly parser and minifier, 10x times faster than existing html compressor for .NET
  - Method `Uglify.HtmlToText` that allows to extract the text from an HTML document
- Compatible with `NET3.5`, `NET4.0+` and `CoreCLR` (`netstandard1.3+`)

## Download

NUglify is available as a NuGet package: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/NUglify.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUglify/)

## Usage

The main entry point for the API is the `Uglify` class:

For JavaScript:

```csharp
var result = Uglify.Js("var x = 5; var y = 6;");
Console.WriteLine(result.Code);   // prints: var x=5,y=6
```

For Css:

```csharp
var result = Uglify.Css("div { color: #FFF; }");
Console.WriteLine(result.Code);   // prints: div{color:#fff}
```

For Html:

```csharp
var result = Uglify.Html("<div>  <p>This is <em>   a text    </em></p>   </div>");
Console.WriteLine(result.Code);   // prints: <div><p>This is <em>a text</em></div>
```

Extract text from Html:

```csharp
var result = Uglify.HtmlToText("<div>  <p>This is <em>   a text    </em></p>   </div>");
Console.WriteLine(result.Code);   // prints: This is a text
```

## Known Issues

See the issues pages on github, however the only real known issue is:

If you overload the `async` keyword as an identifier, like so:

```
function (async) {
    async = 1; // this will work
    async[1] = 2; // this will work
    async(); // this line will be stripped
    async(a,b); // this will end up as: a,b
}
```
you'll see the commented behaviour. This is a difficult job to fix, but PRs welcome. I don't think this is a worth the effort to fix right now, you've got to be a real sadist to be doing this to yourself in the first place.
See #130 if you want to try and fix it yourself.

## Questions

- [ ] Can we collaborate with a project like [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) to leverage on a common JavaScript parser infrastructure?
- [ ] Can we utilise [AngleSharp](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp) for the HTML/Css minification?
